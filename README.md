# KStracker
Kickstarter tracker
This is an amended version of a KS tracker that I wrote back in October 2014
http://raspi.tv/2014/programming-a-kickstarter-tracker-in-python-part-2

It's been updated because some of the 'on-page' stuff it scrapes data from has changed on KickStarter.

I also added a new feature to include an accurate Â£/hr raised track.

It's a fun project. A lot more could be done...

Logging of stats
Graphing
Tweets
Push notifications

It will probably break again at some point if KS change their on-page information, but that's OK. 
We'll fix it again
